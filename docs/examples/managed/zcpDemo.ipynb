Deleting entities by primary key is much faster and lighter than deleting them by complex boolean expressions. This is because Milvus executes queries first when deleting data by complex boolean expressions.\\nDeleted entities can still be retrieved immediately after the deletion if the consistency level is set lower than Strong.\\nEntities deleted beyond the pre-specified span of time for Time Travel cannot be retrieved again.\\nFrequent deletion operations will impact the system performance.\\nBefore deleting entities by comlpex boolean expressions, make sure the collection has been loaded.\\nDeleting entities by complex boolean expressions is not an atomic operation. Therefore, if it fails halfway through, some data may still be deleted.\\nDeleting entities by complex boolean expressions is supported only when the consistency is set to Bounded.

Calling it too often will cause fragmented data that will need to be cleaned later on.\\nLimits\\nUpdating primary key fields is not supported by upsert().\\nupsert() is not applicable and an error can occur if autoID is set to True for primary key fields.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.805656909942627)]"
